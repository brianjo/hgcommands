``` 
hg branch \[-fC\] \[NAME\]

aliases: br

(deprecated. use 'hg bookmark' instead)

    This command does nothing meaningful and will be removed in the future.

    For now, it always prints "default" or raise an exception if NAME or -C is
    provided.

(some details hidden, use --verbose to show complete help)
