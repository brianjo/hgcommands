summarize working directory state

    This generates a brief summary of the working directory state, including
    parents, branch, commit status, phase and available updates.

    With the --remote option, this will check the default paths for incoming
    and outgoing changes. This can be time-consuming.

    Returns 0 on success.

Options:

--remote check for push and pull
