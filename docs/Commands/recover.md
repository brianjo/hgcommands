``` 
hg recover

roll back an interrupted transaction

    Recover from an interrupted commit or pull.

    This command tries to fix the repository status after an interrupted
    operation. It should only be necessary when Mercurial suggests it.

    Returns 0 if successful, 1 if nothing to recover.
